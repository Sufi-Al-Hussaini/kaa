        <description>Kaa notification subsystem demo app based on Java SDK</description>
        <details>

This simple app demonstrates Kaa notification subsystem capabilities on Java SDK.

<h2>Installation</h2>
Download the jar file to your device by clicking the "Binary" button on the left. Make sure that the you have Java installed on your device. Run application using following command in console:
<pre>
$ java -jar NotificationDemo.jar
</pre>

<h2>Playing around</h2>
Make sure that the Kaa sandbox is up and running. Starting the "Notification demo" app, you will get a list of notification topics accessible to the endpoint. Thre will be two topics in the list - mandatory and optional. You will also receive notification for mandatory topic automatically. Application will subscribe to optional topic. Once subsribed, you will also receive notification for optional topic<br/><br/>

Now it's time to test things out: navigate to the Kaa server administrative interface by clicking on the "Administrative console" link from the Sandbox screen. Log in as a tenant developer (devuser / devuser123), and navigate to the "Notification demo" application, then select "Notification topics". From here you can <a href="https://docs.kaaproject.org/display/KAA/Administration+UI+guide#AdministrationUIguide-Addingnotificationtopics">manage topics</a> and send notifications. Do not forget to <a href="https://docs.kaaproject.org/display/KAA/Administration+UI+guide#AdministrationUIguide-Addnotificationtopictoendpointgroup">assign</a> newly created topics to the "all" endpoint group - otherwise the endpoint will not be able to see them. Make sure you have tried subscribing to an optional topic after sending a long-lived notification!

Please note that all features of <a href="https://docs.kaaproject.org/display/KAA/Administration+UI+guide">Administrative UI</a> are also supported by <a href="https://docs.kaaproject.org/display/KAA/Admin+REST+API">REST API</a>.

<h2>What's next?</h2>
Get the source code by clicking the "Source" button on the left and start hacking!<br/><br/>
