This app demonstrates Kaa event subsystem capabilities on Android platform.

<h2>Installation</h2>
Download the .apk to your Android device by clicking the "Binary" button on the left. Make sure that the device permits installing apps from "Unknown sources". Open the downloaded apk and follow the on-screen instructions.

<h2>Playing around</h2>
Make sure that the Kaa sandbox is up and running. You will need to install this application on two devices at least. 
Start application on one of the devices and choose "Smart House". Any password will be accepted since <a href="https://docs.kaaproject.org/display/KAA/Attaching+endpoints+to+users#Attachingendpointstousers-Trustfuluserverifier">trustful user verifier</a> is used for demonstration purposes.<br/><br/>
Start application on one of the devices and choose "Thermostat" or "Sound System". This will cause autogenerated QR code to appear on the device screen. Use first device (smart house) application to scan this QR code and connect second device to the same user. Now you can control your thermostat or sound system from the smart house application.<br/><br/>

Please note that all features of <a href="https://docs.kaaproject.org/display/KAA/Administration+UI+guide">Administrative UI</a> are also supported by <a href="https://docs.kaaproject.org/display/KAA/Admin+REST+API">REST API</a>.

<h2>What's next?</h2>
