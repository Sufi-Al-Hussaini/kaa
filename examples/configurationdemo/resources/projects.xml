This simple app demonstrates Kaa configuration subsystem capabilities on Java SDK.

<h2>Installation</h2>
Download the jar file to your device by clicking the "Binary" button on the left. Make sure that the you have Java installed on your device. Run application using following command in console:
<pre>
$ java -jar ConfigurationDemo.jar
</pre>

<h2>Playing around</h2>
Make sure that the Kaa sandbox is up and running. Starting the "Configuration demo" app, you will get a latest configuration accessible to the endpoint. This configuration is a list of links to Kaa resources.<br/><br/>

Now it's time to test things out: navigate to the Kaa server administrative interface by clicking on the "Administrative console" link from the Sandbox screen. Log in as a tenant developer (devuser / devuser123), and navigate to the "Configuration demo" application, then select "Endpoint groups". From here you can <a href="https://docs.kaaproject.org/display/KAA/Administration+UI+guide#AdministrationUIguide-Addingendpointgroups">manage endpoint groups</a> and <a href="https://docs.kaaproject.org/display/KAA/Administration+UI+guide#AdministrationUIguide-Addconfigurationtoendpointgroup">update endpoint configuration</a>. Do not forget to activate updated configuration - otherwise the endpoint will not be able to see it. Make sure you have tried updating configuration for endpoint group "All" and received it on your device!<br/><br/>

Please note that all features of <a href="https://docs.kaaproject.org/display/KAA/Administration+UI+guide">Administrative UI</a> are also supported by <a href="https://docs.kaaproject.org/display/KAA/Admin+REST+API">REST API</a>.

<h2>What's next?</h2>
Get the source code by clicking the "Source" button on the left and start hacking!<br/><br/>
