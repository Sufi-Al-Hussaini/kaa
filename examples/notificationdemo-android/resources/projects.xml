This simple app demonstrates Kaa notification subsystem capabilities on Android platform.

<h2>Installation</h2>
Download the .apk to your Android device by clicking the "Binary" button on the left. Make sure that the device permits installing apps from "Unknown sources". Open the downloaded apk and follow the on-screen instructions.

<h2>Playing around</h2>
Make sure that the Kaa sandbox is up and running. Opening the "Kaa Notification Demo" app, you will get a list of notification topics accessible to the endpoint. Optional topics will have an active checkbox to the right of the name, that you can select or unselect to manage subscriptions. Mandatory topics will always be active.<br/><br/>

Now it's time to test things out: navigate to the Kaa server administrative interface by clicking on the "Administrative console" link from the Sandbox screen. Log in as a tenant developer (devuser / devuser123), and navigate to the "Android notification" application, then select "Notification topics". From here you can <a href="https://docs.kaaproject.org/display/KAA/Administration+UI+guide#AdministrationUIguide-Addingnotificationtopics">manage topics</a>, and send notifications. Do not forget to <a href="https://docs.kaaproject.org/display/KAA/Administration+UI+guide#AdministrationUIguide-Addnotificationtopictoendpointgroup">assign</a> newly created topics to the "all" endpoint group - otherwise the endpoint will not be able to see them. Make sure you have tried subscribing to an optional topic after sending a long-lived notification!

Please note that all features of <a href="https://docs.kaaproject.org/display/KAA/Administration+UI+guide">Administrative UI</a> are also supported by <a href="https://docs.kaaproject.org/display/KAA/Admin+REST+API">REST API</a>.

<h2>What's next?</h2>
Get the source code by clicking the "Source" button on the left and start hacking!<br/><br/>
